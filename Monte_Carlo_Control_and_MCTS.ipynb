    "\n",
    "On the other hand, **MCTS** is more **scalable** and can be used in problems where the state-action space is too big to fit in memory. This is the case of games like chess or Go. In fact, MCTS (with the extension that we're going to present in the next section and with neural networks) is the algorithm that allowed DeepMind to create AlphaGo, the first AI that was able to beat the world champion in Go. \n",

    "- **MCC** is the **best** algorithm in terms of **performance** but it **requires** a **lot of data** to learn a good policy\n",
    "- **MCTS** is **scalable** and can be used in problems where the state-action space is too big to fit in memory, but it **does not always find the optimal policy**\n",
    "- **RAVE** is an **extension** of **MCTS** that **speeds up** the **learning** of the **action values** by **introducing a bias**. However, it **does not seem** to **give a definitive boost** to the performance of our algorithm, probably due to the fact that in our problem the **action space** is **too small** to really receive a benefit from this heuristic, differently from other problems where the action space is much bigger like in Go."

    "On the other hand, **MCTS** is more **scalable** and can be used in problems where the state-action space is too big to fit in memory. This is the case of games like chess or Go. In fact, MCTS (with the extension that we're going to present in the next section, i.e. RAVE, and with neural networks) is the algorithm that allowed DeepMind to create AlphaGo, the first AI that was able to beat the world champion in Go. \n",
